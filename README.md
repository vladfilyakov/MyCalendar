# My Calendar

This is my home work for coding challenge from Microsoft Outlook iOS team:

"Build an iOS app that replicates the basic features described below of the Calendar and Agenda views on the [Outlook iOS (iPhone) app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-outlook-email-calendar/id951937596?mt=8)."

https://github.com/outlook/jobs/blob/fbb94c2cfeaeca0a8c16920c1a2a1f0e90b0c9e8/instructions/ios/ios-engineer.md

It was well received and I got an offer from them afterwards.
